# Simple_Reverse_Shell_v1
This is a simple reverse shell program created in Python. This is only for educational purpose and has been intended for beginners only.

# What features will V2 have?
Well, since it is intended only for beginners don't expect a lot of features. One of the major changes will be the support for muti-threading to handle multiple connections and to support simultaneous operations.

# Can I contribute?
Of course you can, but since it is intended for beginners so let's keep it that way.

# Can I use it for hacking?
Well, I am not responsible for what you do with this. Use it at your own risk. This is strictly meant for educational purpose only. I wonder how will you even use such a simple program for hacking. Also, it is programmed in such a way that even client will recive output from the server program. So if you are looking for a small challenge, you can try to change the code to remove that functionality ;) . 

# There are some issues. Where Can I report them?

Feel free to report issues. Well, I think it is pretty self-evident on how to raise issues. Github has made it pretty easy and obvious. It is just a click of button. Anyway, thanks for showing interest and raising issues.

# Happy Coding!
